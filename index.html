            <h3>Student</h3>
            <p>I am Shourov.This is my first website.This is amezing.I am very happy.I am a person who is positive about
                every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I
                like
                to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise
                in
                the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like
                to
                smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like
                to
                do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in
                summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be
                alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; I like the
                beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and
                comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people.
                And, I like to laugh. </p>
